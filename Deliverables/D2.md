## Functional requirements
1. Set up a server/client system to store information and connect users in roommate groups.
2. User set notification reminders that inform user of expense summaries.
3. Periodic cash flow summaries that inform user of money earned vs. money spent.
4. Projected purchases to anticipate expenses before they are made (weekly groceries, gas, etc...).
5. Loan tracking to manage user tuition fees and due dates.
6. Savings plans that reduce unnecessary expenses in order to funnel towards larger expenses (such as tuition).

## Non-functional requirements
1. User friendly interface that is easy to learn and understand.
2. Informational pages that explain budgeting concepts.
3. Cross-platform usability for IOS and android.
4. Simple app navigation
5. Roommate groups that share necessary financial expense (rent, electricity bill, etc...).

## MVP
Our minimum viable product will contain the ability to add expenses, and add how you want money to be spent. The app should be able to display the money already sorted via the user's desires accurately and reliably. We will validate the functional requirements (1), (3), and (6) found above, alongside the non-functional requirements (1). We will test this as developerss to make sure that it is technically functional for the non-functional requirements, then try to get interviews/app-testers that will validate whether we meet the ease-of-use requirement.
