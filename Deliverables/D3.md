# System Description

Provide a brief textual description of your system. The first paragraph of the description
must contain the problem statement, the product position statement, and the value
proposition of your system (you can refine/update what you presented in D.2). The
following paragraphs should describe the key requirements of the system. This description
should be consistent with D.2 stakeholders, requirements, use cases, and user stories.
Again, refinements/updates are welcome since your understanding of the system is
constantly evolving.

[Paragraph 1]
(Problem statement). (Product position statement). (Value proposition).

[Paragraph 2]
(Key requirements). 


Use Bold every time that you use a noun that is a class in your model. Use Italic every
time that you use a noun that is an attribute in your model. Use Underline every time
that you use a noun or verb that is an association in your model.


# Model

Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram. Represent proper
cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations. Also include the association names.
